# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for class imbalance problems in Machine Learning

A deep learning dissertation project to demonstrate a two-step approach for class imbalance problems in machine learning using SMOTE and GANs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses SMOTE and GANs to produce diverse synthetic samples for under represented class with diverse imbalance ratios.
- Implemented using Tensorflow, by default runs on GPU.
- Works with any labelled data source.
- Sample scripts for 5 different data sources with different class imbalance ratios.
- Well-documented report available as "final_report.pdf"

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NediffNixon/generative-ai-for-class-imbalance-problems.git
cd generative-ai-for-class-imbalance-problems

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Example Scripts
Example notebook scripts (in example_notebooks folder) are available to test the implementation.

## NOTE
Some datasets are not able in "data" folder because of their large size.
