# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for class imbalance problems in Machine Learning

This project explores a hybrid data augmentation strategy using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** followed by a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to address severe class imbalance in classification tasks.

The goal is to improve model generalisation on minority classes by leveraging the strengths of both classical oversampling and generative modelling.

## üß† Overview

Class imbalance remains a major challenge in many real-world datasets, where some classes are underrepresented, leading to biased models. This project proposes:

1. **Step 1 ‚Äì SMOTE**: Generate initial synthetic samples using nearest neighbours interpolation.
2. **Step 2 ‚Äì GAN**: Further enhance the minority class with more realistic, high-variance synthetic samples learned by a GAN model trained only on the minority class.

## üìä Example Scripts
Example notebook scripts (in example_notebooks folder) are available to test the implementation.

üìù Notes
SMOTE works well when classes are not extremely sparse, but it can create noisy points if not tuned carefully (e.g., number of neighbors).

The GAN is trained only on the minority class, not the full dataset. This ensures it focuses on capturing that class's structure.

You may need to balance diversity vs. overfitting when generating samples from the GAN‚Äîearly stopping and validation is key.

The synthetic data should always be validated visually or statistically before training.

This approach is not always better than SMOTE or GANs alone‚Äîevaluate based on your dataset.
